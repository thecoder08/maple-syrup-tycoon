# Maple Syrup Tycoon
Once a year during the spring, our family taps Maple trees, collects the sap, and boils it into syrup. I thought it would be fun to make a tycoon game based on this process.

In MST (maple syrup tycoon), your goal is to upgrade your syrup operation by starting out small, tapping only a few trees, and gradually growing into a maple syrup megacomplex!

MST worlds are randomly generated from a seed.

This is also my first game with vector graphics, so be warned.
